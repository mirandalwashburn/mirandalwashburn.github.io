            </div>

            <div class="mod__content__txt">
                <p>Inside the app, click the menu bar in the top left corner to see all the things you can do. We call these widgets, but you can call them tasks, menu items or your “can-do” list — whatever makes your soul sing. </p>
                <p>In Online Banking, these widgets appear in grey boxes on the left side of the page (or in the drop-down menu on mobile). </p>
                <p>Here are some things you can do inside the app AND in Online Banking. Feel free to look around!</p>

                <ul class="list list-carats">
                    <li>View Balances: Click Dashboard to see an overview of your account balances and transactions. If you choose Snapshot, you’ll also get a sneak peek at your account balances whenever the app opens, a pretty sweet feature that most bank apps don’t have! </li>
                    <li>View Accounts: To view specific account details, click Accounts in the main menu, then choose your account. </li>
                    <li>See a Transaction: Click on a transaction for specifics, like where and when that purchase was made. ($118 at Olive Garden??? Guess it’s macaroni-from-a-box this week!) </li>
                    <li>Find Your Account Number: Click on the Details tab. Scroll down to your Incoming Wires Account Number. Use the first 10 digits – basically, everything before the dash. </li>
                    <li>Transfer Money: Click Transfers in the Main Menu. Choose the accounts you want money deducted FROM and sent TO. Enter the transfer amount, review and click Complete Transfer. Easy-peasy.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There’s lots more to do and see, but there’s plenty of time to dig deeper. In the meantime, pat yourself on the back for completing Module 1 — and check the box below so we know how awesome you are!</p>
